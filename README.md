# 🎄 The Twelve Days of Christmas in Rust 🎅

*Fa la la la la, la la la la!* Welcome to a festive Rust implementation of the classic Christmas carol! This project combines the joy of the holiday season with the power and safety of Rust.

## 🎅 About This Project

This Rust program sings the beloved "Twelve Days of Christmas" carol with a programming twist! It demonstrates various Rust concepts while spreading holiday cheer.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Rust 2021 Edition
- **Build Tool**: Cargo
- **Dependency Management**: Cargo.toml
- **Tool Management**: `mise` (for easy setup)

## 🎄 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Install `mise` (formerly rtx) for tool management:
   ```bash
   curl https://mise.jdx.dev/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. Install Rust and its default components:
   ```bash
   mise install rust
   ```

3. Verify your installation:
   ```bash
   cargo --version
   rustc --version
   ```

### 🏗️ Building the Project

To build the project, simply run:

```bash
cargo build
```

### 🎶 Running the Carol

To hear the carol, run:

```bash
cargo run
```

## 🎁 Rust Concepts Explored

This project helps strengthen your understanding of:

- **Pattern Matching**: Elegantly handle different days of Christmas
- **Collections**: Using `Vec` and slices to store and manipulate the gifts
- **Iterators**: Chain, enumerate, and collect like a pro
- **String Manipulation**: Formatting the verses with proper grammar
- **Control Flow**: `for` loops, `match` expressions, and more
- **Constants and Statics**: For immutable data that's known at compile-time
- **Functions and Macros**: Organizing code into reusable components

## 🎄 Example Output

```
On the first day of Christmas,
my true love sent to me
A partridge in a pear tree.

On the second day of Christmas,
my true love sent to me
Two turtle doves,
And a partridge in a pear tree.

...and so on through all twelve days!
```
